# ☕ Coffee Lab — the Indian coffee directory

One place to know everything about coffee in India: browse 613 specialty beans from 58 roasters, match a coffee to your taste in a 2-minute quiz, and learn how coffee actually works.

## Run it

No build, no install. Either:

**Option A — just open it**
Double-click `index.html`. Everything (including the dataset) is embedded, so it works straight off the filesystem.

**Option B — local server (recommended)**
```bash
cd coffee-lab
python3 -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000
```

Fonts load from Google Fonts when online; the site falls back to system fonts offline.

## Pages

## Data

- Source: *The Great Indian Specialty Coffee Directory* (public Google Sheet).
- `build_data.py` contains the raw rows and derives normalised fields (roast level 1–5, flavour families, milk/black/cold suitability, suggested brews, slugs). Regenerate `js/data.js` with:
  ```bash
  python3 build_data.py            # embedded rows
  python3 build_data.py export.csv # or: the sheet’s File → Download → CSV export (all rows, incl. product links)
  ```
- To add coffees: append rows to the `RAW` block in `build_data.py` and re-run. No other file changes needed.
